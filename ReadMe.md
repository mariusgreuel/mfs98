# MFS Modellflugsimulator '98 Edition

MFS98 was my fourth version of a 3D R/C helicopter simulator for the PC. It was written in 1998 for [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95).

Enhancements to the previous version [MFS96](https://github.com/mariusgreuel/mfs96) include
- Support for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 via DirectDraw
- Support for an external R/C transmitter via a Windows 95 [VXD driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxD) or a [Windows NT driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_Driver_Model)
- Wireframe skybox and shadow for better orientation

To compile the project, you need Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. Precompiled binaries can be found in the bin folder.
